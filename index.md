Welcome to Stanford in Minecraft! This project aims to recreate the Stanford campus at a 1:1 scale. We hope this project allows people to gather in a familiar space from afar, and inspires greater appreciation of and critical thinking about the land, architecture, landscaping, and built environment of Stanford.
This game is a project created by Stanford student volunteers and not by Stanford University.
