Welcome to Stanford in Minecraft! This project aims to recreate the Stanford campus at a 1:1 scale. We hope this project allows people to gather in a familiar space from afar, and inspires greater appreciation of and critical thinking about the land, architecture, landscaping, and built environment of Stanford.

This game is a project created by Stanford student volunteers and not by Stanford University.

### accessing the server:
The server can be accessed through a 1.16.5 Java Edition client at lsjucraft.xyz. **You need a Java edition Minecraft account to do so. The server currently doesn't work on Console versions like Switch, Xbox, or iOS versions.**
There are three permissions levels in the campus world:
- Any member of the public can access the world in adventure mode.
- Whitelisted players can build in the world. (See “getting started” below).
- Campus Moderators are granted WorldEdit permissions. If you’re interested in planning and directing construction projects and ensuring build accuracy, contact mbyun@stanford.edu.
